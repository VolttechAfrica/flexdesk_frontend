# AI Features

## Overview
This document describes FlexDesk's AI-powered capabilities, integration patterns, and safety guardrails.

## Use Cases by Role
- Administrators: anomaly detection (attendance, payments), trend summaries, forecasting
- Teachers: lesson plan scaffolds, formative assessment suggestions, rubric generation
- Students: study plan recommendations, content summarization, practice question generation
- Parents: weekly summaries, actionable alerts, communication drafting
- Support: FAQ triage and suggested resolutions

## Core AI Capabilities

### AI Teaching Assistant
- In-class support for Q&A, concept explanations, and scaffolding
- Generates differentiated examples and remediation steps
- Integrates with lesson context and recent class activity

### AI Lesson Planner
- Drafts lesson outlines with objectives, materials, timing, and assessments
- Aligns with curriculum standards (if provided by backend)
- Offers differentiation and extension activities

### Teacher and Admin Helper (Task Delegation Agent)
- Create and delegate tasks (e.g., "Prepare attendance report", "Draft fee reminder emails")
- Tracks task status and returns results or drafts for review
- Integrates with notifications and role-based permissions

### AI Call Assistants
- Handle inbound calls: FAQs, announcements, routing to staff
- Place outbound calls: reminders (payments, events), attendance follow-ups
- Call summaries with structured outcomes (e.g., reached/voicemail, next steps)

### Analytics and Insights
- Summarizes trends across attendance, enrollment, and finance
- Surfaces risks, anomalies, and suggested actions

## Integration Patterns
- Client-triggered requests via `lib/services/*` calling backend AI endpoints
- Batch analytics jobs computed server-side and surfaced via dashboards
- Edge-safe summaries generated on demand with caching
- Call assistants integrate via telephony provider webhooks (server)

## Data Inputs
- Attendance, enrollment, finance events, assessment metadata
- Course schedules, user roles and permissions
- Content and assets (where permitted)
- Telephony call metadata (server-side only)

## Outputs
- Natural language summaries and recommendations
- Structured insights (scores, risk flags, trends)
- Action suggestions with links to relevant flows
- Call transcripts/summaries and disposition

## UX Principles
- Keep humans in control: editable suggestions, preview before apply
- Clarity: show why an insight appears; include data sources/time ranges
- Speed: async operations with progress and retry states

## Safety and Guardrails
- Privacy: only use data authorized by the userâ€™s role and permissions
- Security: never expose raw PII in prompts or outputs unnecessarily
- Reliability: show confidence/limitations; allow reporting issues
- Bias mitigation: prefer transparent heuristics; add human review for high-stakes
- Telephony: consent and recording disclosures where required by law

## Configuration
- Backend AI endpoints and providers are configured server-side
- Frontend should rely on service wrappers, not call providers directly
- Telephony providers (e.g., Twilio) configured via server env vars and webhooks

## Developer Guidance
- Add new AI features as services in `lib/services/` (e.g., `insights.ts`, `aiCalls.ts`)
- Keep types in `lib/types/` and UI in `components/`
- Gate features by role/permission using `ProtectedRoute` and `ROLE_ROUTES`

## Future Work
- Fine-tuned domain models for education-specific tasks
- On-device hints for low-latency interactions
- Explainability views for insights
